# Governance

## Project model

`mem-kernel-rs` is currently maintainer-led.

- Maintainers review and merge pull requests.
- Significant API or behavior changes should be discussed in an issue first.
- Backward compatibility changes must be documented in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Decision making

- Prefer consensus in PR discussion.
- If consensus is not reached in a reasonable time, maintainers decide.

## Release model

- Pre-1.0 releases may include breaking changes.
- Breaking changes must be called out clearly in release notes.

## Becoming a maintainer

Contributors who consistently provide high-quality PRs, reviews, and project support
may be invited as maintainers.
